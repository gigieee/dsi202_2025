  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    PawPal is a community-driven project dedicated to rescuing and rehoming stray dogs and cats. Our mission is to provide second chances for abandoned animals through care, compassion, and connection with loving families.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    We collaborate with volunteers, vets, and kind-hearted people across the country to ensure that no animal is left behind. Our platform makes it easy to explore adoptable pets, donate for medical treatments, or support through your time and voice.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Whether you're here to adopt a furry friend or contribute to their well-being, PawPal welcomes you to be part of this life-saving journey. Together, we can make a lasting impact.
